  description: The default cube in Unity is a simple 3D object consisting of six
    square faces, forming a perfect cube. It is created with a standard material,
    has no textures, and includes a Mesh Filter, Mesh Renderer, and a Box Collider
    by default. Its dimensions are 1 unit per side, and it serves as a basic building
    block for prototyping or creating simple 3D objects.
