  objectName: Amberite Ore
  description: "A rare and striking mineral, Amberite glows with a warm, fiery hue
    that seems to catch and hold the light like a shard of frozen sunset. Found deep
    within volcanic caverns or nestled in the heart of rocky plateaus, the ore is
    veined with darker streaks of bronze and crimson, giving it an otherworldly appearance.
    Despite its radiant color, Amberite is remarkably tough, prized by blacksmiths
    and alchemists alike for its ability to forge lightweight yet resilient alloys.
    Some say the ore retains a hint of the earth\u2019s primal heat, making it warm
    to the touch even in the coldest of climates.\n"
