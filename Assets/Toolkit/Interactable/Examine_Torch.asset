  objectName: Metal Torch
  description: A sturdy torch crafted from blackened iron, designed to withstand
    the wear of adventuring. The shaft is ridged for a firm grip, and its head flares
    outward to hold the tightly wrapped cloth soaked in oil. The metal frame protects
    the flame from light breezes while allowing it to cast flickering shadows against
    the walls. Though plain in design, this torch is dependable, its weight and durability
    making it useful even as a makeshift weapon in desperate moments.
